    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would suggest the potential client should firstly install security plugins for the webside either free or payed services. Then i would suggest to get 
       SSL sertificate that encrypts the data to and from the server. Update the site regularly and security programs so the website and security plugins are secured. Use secure passwords and change them often and dont use: your name, kids name, birthdays and rather use password generators instead and if you can't remember the password i would suggest 
        to use a thirdparty password manager. I would also suggest to 
        Use automatic back-up service that saves your website. If your site does happen to be hacked you have atleast an prehacked website that can be reinstalled with security measures in place. Use anti-Malware software to secure your website,
        a good hosting provider often includes this for free and Use security tools to evaluate the site regularly for exstra safety measures.
